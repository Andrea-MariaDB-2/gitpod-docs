# Browser Extension

Creating a workspace is as easy as prefixing any GitHub URL with `gitpod.io#`. 
To enjoy the real one-click experience, we built a Gitpod browser extension.

The extension simply adds a button to GitHub, which does the prefixing for you. Nothing more.

We provide an extension for
  - [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gitpod-online-ide/dodmmooeoklaejobgleioelladacbeki)
    and
  - [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/gitpod/).
