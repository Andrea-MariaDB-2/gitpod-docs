# Getting started with Gitpod

Gitpod delivers the IDE part for the web-based development flows of common code hosting platforms. This example 
shows how to use Gitpod with a GitHub repository.

1. Point your browser to some GitHub repository, e.g. TODO
2. Either prefix the URL in the address bar of your browser with `gitpod.io/` or push the _Gitpod_ button if you 
have installed the [Gitpod Browser Extension](2_Browser_Extension.md).
3. If you are using Gitpod for the first time, you will be asked to authorize the access to your GitHub account. 
Gitpod stores and uses the authorization token for your account until you revoke it in your GitHub account 
settings.
4. Gitpod now launches a [workspace container](1_2_Workspaces.md) for you in the cloud. It will also clone the 
branch of the GitHub repository you were coming from, and run startup scripts in case they are defined in a 
[Gitpod configuration file]() for the repository.
5. Once the workspace is ready, Gitpod starts the Theia IDE frontend in your browser. You can now start browsing, 
editing, reviewing the code. Read the section on [editor features](4_2_Editor_Features) for more details on the capabilities of the IDE.
6. From within the IDE, you can report back to GitHub, e.g. by creating a PR, pushing to remote branches, or
adding review comments. Read more about this in our section on [GitHub integration](4_3_Git_and_GitHub_Integration.md).
7. Once you are done, close the IDE or just let it time out. Gitpod will automatically take care of disposing all 
resources and saving your workspace's state, such that you can revisit it later from the [dashboard](1_3_Dashboard.md).
